#smf-vanilla-app
Binary files and Smartface project files for an app that you can build upon in a TDD fashion.

Install the app into an emulator or into a device.

Load scripts on the fly and have a fast development cycle.

Will add a tutorial later.

An example set of scripts will be at [smf-experiments](https://github.com/serkanserttop/smf-experiments)
